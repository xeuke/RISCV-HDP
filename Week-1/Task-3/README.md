## Task-3: Design the same ALU code in Verilog and verify it using iVerilog and GTKwave
### Here is a tutorial of how to run this "alu.v" and "alu_tb.v" file using iVerilog and GTKwave.
  - Update the operand 'A' and 'B'value at lines  61-62 of this code and run the code using the same commands as given in the script to let ALU perform all the outputs and print the results.
