## Week-3: Develop RISC-V with peripherals and drivers for an application.
### Application: Automated Room-Temperature Monitoring and Control System Using RISC-V
This project involves developing an automated room temperature monitoring and control system using a custom RISC-V processor. The system will read the initial room temperature from a sensor at the start of the recording time and then simulate an increase in room temperature by 1 degree Celsius every two hours over the next eight hours. The system will be designed to run on a custom RISC-V architecture, ensuring efficient processing and low power consumption.
